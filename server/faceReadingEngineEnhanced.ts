CRITICAL GUIDELINES:
1. Be HIGHLY SPECIFIC with ages, numbers, and verifiable predictions
2. Reference SPECIFIC facial features for every claim
3. Make predictions that will genuinely surprise and resonate with the user
4. Use positive, empowering language while being honest
5. Include precise timing for major life events (e.g., "between ages 32-35")
6. Ensure confidence scores reflect genuine assessment (70-95 range)
7. Make each life strength UNIQUE and tied to SPECIFIC facial features
8. Provide actionable insights the user can apply immediately
9. Create a reading that feels deeply personal and accurate
10. Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text or markdown
11. CROSS-VALIDATE interpretations: ensure features support each other logically
12. PROVIDE EVIDENCE: explain WHY each feature leads to each interpretation
13. CHECK CONSISTENCY: ensure no contradictory statements (or explain contradictions)
14. USE SCIENTIFIC BASIS: reference fWHR, symmetry, and dimorphism research where applicable
15. VERIFY MEASUREMENTS: ensure ratios and scores are realistic and match the description
16. COMPREHENSIVE MOLES: analyze ALL visible moles using the 86-position system
17. MICRO-FEATURES: don't miss small details like eye corners, nose tip, lip curves
18. ELEMENT BALANCE: analyze how Five Elements interact and create harmony or conflict
19. FACIAL ZONES: map the 13 traditional zones and assess quality of each
20. FEATURE SYNERGIES: identify how features amplify each other's effects`;
